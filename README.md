Introduction
This project contains scripts to gather detailed system information and Wi-Fi profiles along with their passwords, and send this information to a specified Discord webhook. The scripts are divided into two PowerShell scripts and one batch file for execution.

Prerequisites:
- Windows OS
- PowerShell
- Discord

# Step 1:
## Install discord, and setup a channel to recieve the messages.
1. Once you have a channel setup go to the setting of it and under "integrations" you will see the webhook option.
2. Select it and create a New Webhook.
3. Once you've created it, go ahead and copy the link for it. We will be using this later.
